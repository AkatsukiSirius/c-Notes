    "    - ### Program functionality is grouped into and carried out by objects;\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Program functionality as we're coding it up is grouped into very discrete sections, and then, it is carried out by objects that are created from those sections;\n",
    "        \n",

    "\n",
    "    - ### Code is divided into stand-alone groups, classes;\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - Can very simply construct a program that as multiple classes each class providing a very specific functionality;\n",
    "        \n",
    "        - Then, use that class to build the objects that actually carry out that functionality;\n",
    "        \n",
    "    - ### Code can be easily resused;\n",
    "    \n",
    "        - In different part of program, utilize that class to create objects to carry out functionalities;\n",

    "        -  Expose those classes to other applications\n",
    "        \n",
